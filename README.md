# How to draw map with route in Python

This is a simple example that generates and displays a map with a route. The map is generated using Folium and based on a list of coordinates. The coordinates represent waypoints along the route.

# Requirements

Python 3.6+
Flask
Folium
You can install the required Python packages with pip:

`pip install flask folium`

# Usage

1. In points.py file, provide a dict with points for drawing route on your map (file already contains example route between Poznań and Gorzów Wielkopolski, received from TomTom Routing API: https://developer.tomtom.com/routing-api/api-explorer 
2. Run generate_map.py to generate HTML file that includes map with route. The HTML file is generated by folium library, which is inspired by leaflet.js. Map is being saved inside static/maps folder.
3. Run app.py to start Flask application that will display the generated map.
4. This is just an example, play around with it or incorporate it to you project. Have fun!

## Notes

1. The map is a series of straight lines connecting the points in the order they appear in the points list.
2. If you want to update the map, you need to update the points list in points.py, re-run the generate_map.py script, and restart the Flask app
